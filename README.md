# Channels Stream Links

This is a set of examples for linking movies from external services inside [Channels](https://getchannels.com).

Simply add any of these files to an imports directory in [Channels](https://getchannels.com) and they will be scanned in as movies. When attempting to play them, Channels will open the third party app for the service they belong to and play them.
