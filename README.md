# Channels Stream Links

This is a set of examples for linking movies and TV shows from external streaming services inside [Channels](https://getchannels.com).

Simply add any of these files to your `Imports` directory in [Channels](https://getchannels.com) and they will be scanned in as movies and TV shows. When attempting to play them, Channels will open the third party app for the service they belong to and play them.
